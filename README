dokuwiki-actickets
================================================================================

A DokuWiki plugin to easily crossreference ActiveCollab tickets within pages.



Usage
================================================================================

Put the following line on top of your page to set a global project of the page:

  {{Project:<project-id>}}

example:

  {{Project:123}}

Afterwards you can reference any ticket in the project via

  #<ticket-id>

example:

  #5678

If you don't want to a add a global project ID or want to reference a ticket
from another project, you can add the project ID on a per-ticket basis:

  #<ticket-id>-<project-id>

example:

  #123-5678
